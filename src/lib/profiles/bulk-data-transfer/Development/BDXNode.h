 *      Note that this class manages BDXTransfer objects, which contain state
 *      pertaining to a currently ongoing transfer, and any Weave-related
 *      resources necessary for establishing connections, etc.  The BdxProtocol
 *      class contains the actual protocol logic that handles manipulating these
 *      BDXTransfer objects but it does not contain any state itself.

/*
 * In order to make life easier for users of the bulk data transfer
 * protocol, we provide this server. The word "server" is chosen here
 * even though it can act both as a client or as a server.  While the client
 * is expected to only handle one ongoing transfer at a time, the server may
 * handle many.  Thus, configuring the number of BDXTransfer contained within
 * the server to 1 would make this into a 'client'.
 *
 * Note that the server defers to the BdxProtocol class for handling BDX
 * messages and the proper responses and maintenance of the BDXTransfer state.
 * Thus, this class is mostly responsible for managing these transfers and their
 * Weave-related resources.
 *
 * The main points of entry for users of the BDX Protocol are to call InitBdxSend(),
 * InitBdxReceive(), AwaitBdxReceiveInit(), or AwaitBdxSendInit() after creating and initializing the server
 * (init must be properly called before the server can be used)
 * or obtaining a reference to an existing one. Note that in order to use the first
 * two aforementioned methods, the user must first obtain and configure a BDXTransfer
 * object using NewTransfer().  This allows them the opportunity to configure the
 * callbacks and various parameters affecting the Transfer appropriately before
 * initializing it.
