/**
 *  @brief
 *    The topic identifier.
 *
 *  Topic identifiers are 64-bit quantities with two related
 *  uses/semantics.  First of all, they may be used as a
 *  conventional shorthand for a well-known set of paths, e.g. "the
 *  Nest smoke detector". Topic IDs that are used in this way shall,
 *  like profile identifiers, contain a vendor code that prevents topic
 *  IDs chosen autonomously by disparate vendors from conflicting,
 *  as follows:
 *
 *  | bit 48 - 63 | bit 0 - 47   |
 *  | :----:      | :----:       |
 *  | Vendor ID   | Topic number |
 *
 *  The second use/semantics for topic identifiers arises in that
 *  case of a dynamic subscription between a WDM client and a
 *  publisher. in this case, the publisher shall always supply an
 *  unique topic ID that stands for the specific subscription and
 *  it shall do this whether the subscription was requested using a
 *  well-known topic ID or an arbitrary path list. topic
 *  identifiers of this form are distinguished by having a vendor
 *  code of 0xFFFF.
 *
