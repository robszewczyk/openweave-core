 *  @brief
 *    An abstract class containing confirm and notification method
 *    definitions required by the WDM publisher.
 *
 *  Class PublisherDataManager is an abstract class that spells out
 *  the methods an application implementer must provide in order to
 *  handle the data and status delivered by the publisher in WDM
 *  protocol exchanges. It is one of the two primary components of
 *  the DMPublisher abstract base class.
 *
 *  Note that all of the indication methods below take an exchange
 *  context argument and that it is the responsibility of
 *  implementers of these methods to manage this context. In
 *  particular, to dispose of it when it is no longer needed.
