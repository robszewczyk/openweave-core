 *    An abstract class containing confirm and indication
 *    method definitions required by the WDM client.
 *
 *  Class ClientDataManager is an abstract class that spells out
 *  the methods an application implementer must provide in order to
 *  handle the data and status delivered by the publisher in WDM
 *  protocol exchanges. These methods are, for the most part,
 *  confirmations invoked as a result of the receipt of a response
 *  to a client request and indications of the receipt of a
 *  request from a remote peer. ClientDataManager is one of the
 *  two primary components of the DMClient abstract base class.
