/**
 *  @class Command
 *
 *  @note This class is designed to hide a certain detail in command handling.  Decision has been made to hide the details of
 *    ExchangeContext and authenticator validation, while leaving the handling of PacketBuffers to the application layer.
 *
 *    The utility of this wrapper around command handling is indeed limited, mainly due to the complexity/flexibility involved
 *    in security validation and data serialization/de-serialization.
 *
 *    The details for command validation is still TBD
 *
 *    To adjust the retransmission timing for the In-Progress, Status Report, and also Response message,
 *    the application layer would have to somehow deal with the ExchangeContext object. The best practise
 *    is still TBD, but the application layer has these three choices:
 *
 *    1) Acquire the Exchange Context through #GetExchangeContext and directly evaluate/adjust it.
 *    2) Pre-allocate and configure a Binding during boot up, before any command arrives, and configure it properly
 *    3) Create a temporary Binding using this function BindingPool::NewResponderBindingFromExchangeContext
 *
 *    In both (2) and (3), the application layer can enforce security/timing setting through
 *    Binding::ConfigureExistingExchangeContext. The Binding is never used to generate new exchange contexts for custom commands, so
 *    it doesn't have to be stored within this handle.
 *
 *    The request packet buffer is also not stored within this handle, for there is no obvious use of it. This is especially
 *    true if the application layer can handle this command and send out response directly.
 *
 *    Application layer would receive the packet buffer from the same callback it receives this command handle. If it decides to
 *    handle this command in an async manner, it would have to store both the command handle and the packet buffer.
