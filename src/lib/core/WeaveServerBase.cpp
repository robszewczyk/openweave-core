/**
 * Determine whether an incoming request message to a Weave server should be accepted or discarded.
 *
 * This method is intended to be used by Weave server implementations to implement extensible access control
 * policy for incoming request messages.  Server implementations that rely on delegate objects should call
 * this method early in message processing to determine whether message processing should continue.
 *
 * This method calls the virtual WeaveServerDelegateBase::EnforceAccessControl() method on the supplied delegate to evaluate access
 * control policy for the message.  Weave server delegate classes, and application-specific delegates derived
 * from the standard server classes, should override the virtual method to enforce specific access control
 * policies.
 *
 * @param[in] ec            The ExchangeContext over which the message was received.
 * @param[in] msgProfileId  The profile id of the received message.
 * @param[in] msgType       The message type of the received message.
 * @param[in] msgInfo       A WeaveMessageInfo structure containing information about the received message.
 * @param[in] delegate      The delegate object supplied by the application that can be used to override
 *                          the default message access control policy.
 *
 * @retval true             If the message should be accepted and processed as normal.
 * @retval false            If message processing should stop and the message the should be discarded.

/**
 * Virtual method for determining message-level access control policy for incoming server request messages.
 *
 * This method is called by the Weave server infrastructure to determine whether an incoming request message
 * should be accepted and processed normally, or rejected.  Delegate classes associated with Weave server
 * implementations must override this method to implement an appropriate access control policies for their
 * protocols.  Applications may further override this method to support custom policies beyond those provide
 * by the standard server implementations.
 *
 * Implementations of this method are expected to return a result value of Accepted or Rejected based on
 * the outcome of access control policy evaluation.  Returning a result of Rejected causes a StatusReport
 * to be sent to the requester containing the status Common/AccessDenied.  Alternatively, method implementations
 * can choose to send their own responses, which can be a StatusReport or any other type of message.  In this
 * case, the method should return a result of Reject_RespSent to signal that a response has already been sent.
 * Finally, implementations can return Reject_Silent to indicate that the request should be rejected without
 * sending a response to the requester.
 *
 * Classes that override the EnforceAccessControl() method are required in call cases to call the like-named
 * method on their immediate parent class, be that the WeaveServerDelegateBase class, or a class derived from
 * that class. Overriding methods should first update the result value with their determination of the access
 * control policy, and then call on their base class to make its determination.
 *
 * @param[in] ec            The ExchangeContext over which the message was received.
 * @param[in] msgProfileId  The profile id of the received message.
 * @param[in] msgType       The message type of the received message.
 * @param[in] msgInfo       A WeaveMessageInfo structure containing information about the received message.
 * @param[inout] result     An enumerated value describing the result of access control policy evaluation for
 *                          the received message. Upon entry to the method, the value represents the tentative
 *                          result at the current point in the evaluation process.  Upon return, the result
 *                          is expected to represent the final assessment of access control policy for the
 *                          message.
