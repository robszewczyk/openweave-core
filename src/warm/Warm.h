/**
 *    @file
 *      This file defines API's and platform abstractions
 *      for Nest Labs' Weave Address and Routing Module (WARM).
 *
 *      \page Weave Address Assignment
 *      \section intro Introduction:
 *        Because there are a number of inter-dependencies between interfaces and because
 *        different Device configurations can require different TCP/IP address and route
 *        assignment, it was deemed essential that the logic for controlling IP address
 *        and Route assignment be consolidated into a single module. WARM serves the purpose
 *        of properly adding and removing TCP/IP addresses and Routes to Weave related IP interfaces
 *        as those interfaces transition from active<->inactive.
 *
 *        WARM is intended to be configured at compile time via WarmProjectConfig.h and WarmConfig.h.
 *        WarmProjectConfig.h must accurately reflect the supported features of the device upon which
 *        WARM will execute.
 *
 *        WARM is a portable module that limits its dependency on how a TCP/IP stack and Thread Interface
 *        are configured. For this purpose WARM relies on a Set of Platform API's which
 *        must be implemented by the Platform Integrator.  Furthermore, the Platform Integrator is
 *        responsible for making the various nl::Warm API calls from appropriate execution points within
 *        the Platform code base.
 *
 *      \section theory Theory of Operation:
 *        The Platform code base will call nl::Warm API's to announce a change of State for related
 *        features such as the WiFi interface and Thread interface.  A call to any of these nl::Warm API's
 *        may result in a call by WARM to Platform::RequestInvokeActions().  Platform::RequestInvokeActions()
 *        must be implemented to perform the necessary operations that will call Warm::InvokeActions().  This
 *        process at first glance may appear un-necessarily indirect.  Why wouldn't WARM call InvokeActions
 *        directly?  The answer to that question, is to allow for any task in a multi-tasking system to call
 *        the nl::Warm State Change API's, and to provide a mechanism so that only a specific task will call
 *        the Platform:: API's.  After taking the Platform requirements into consideration, the Platform
 *        Integrator may choose to implement Platform::RequestInvokeActions() so that it posts an event to
 *        the appropriate task that will react by calling Warm::InvokeActions().  If, for a given platform, it is
 *        decided that no such multi-tasking concerns exist, Platform::RequestInvokeActions() can be implemented
 *        to call Warm::InvokeActions() directly.
 *
 *        When Warm::InvokeActions() is called the WARM logic will examine the current System State and
 *        make any necessary Platform:: API calls in order to bring the address and routing State in line
 *        with the System and Configuration State.  These calls are made in a pre-defined order and if any of these API's
 *        return kPlatformResultInProgress, execution of the ordered list will suspend and exit.  Furthermore, when
 *        one of these API's returns kPlatformResultInProgress, it is interpreted that the operation
 *        will complete asynchronously and that the WARM logic should wait for that operation to complete.
 *        Upon operation completion, the Platform code should call Warm::ReportActionComplete(), passing in a
 *        result of kPlatformResultSuccess or kPlatformResultFailure.  Upon receiving this call the WARM
 *        logic will again call Platform::RequestInvokeActions() in order to restart execution of the
 *        ordered action list.
 *
 *        In this way WARM does not require its own task but can instead rely on another task to call into Warm
 *        as appropriate.  Additionally, any task may call one or more of the System State change API's, thus
 *        simplifying integration.
